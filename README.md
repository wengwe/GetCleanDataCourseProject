Clean up steps:
1, read training and testing data respectively.  
2. filter data based on feature names(choose only std and mean) columns. 
3. join data with activity and subject. 
4, merge testing and training data. 
5. creates a second independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
6, breakdown each feature by its properties, make the column names more interpretable.
